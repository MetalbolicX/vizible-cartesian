# Git Commit Message Writer

## Format

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build. For further details on types and formatting, see the [Conventional Commits Specification](references/git-conventions.md).

## Available Scripts

- [get-git-diff.sh](scripts/get-git-diff.sh): A script to retrieve the current staged git diff for analysis. This is the primary tool for understanding what changes are being committed.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get the diff

Run automatically `./.claude/skills/git-commit-writer/scripts/get-git-diff.sh`. Read the output carefully. If the output states "No changes found" or "Not a git repository", halt the process and inform the user.

### Step 2: Analyze the changes

Review the diff output and determine:

- **Scope & Impact**: What files changed, and what architectural domain or module do they belong to?
- **Type**: Does this add functionality (`feat`), resolve an issue (`fix`), restructure code without changing behavior (refactor), or update tooling/documentation (`chore`/`docs`)?
- **Core Intent**: What is the single most important change occurring in this diff?

### Step 3: Write the message

Draft the commit message adhering to these constraints:

- Keep the subject line strictly under 72 characters.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "add feature", not "added feature" or "adds feature").
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Include a body if the why or how of the change requires more context than the subject line allows. Wrap body lines at 72 characters.
- Use the footer to reference external trackers, issues, or breaking changes (e.g., `Closes #123`, `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`).

### Step 4: Output the Final Command

Construct the final git command using the generated message. **Do not execute this command yourself**. You must output it inside a bash code block so the user can review and run it manually.

If your message includes a body or footer, format the command using multiple `-m` flags or a multiline string.

Example output format:

```sh
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login with Google" -m "Implements Google OAuth2 flow using the existing session management system. Users can now sign in with their Google account." -m "Closes #142"
```

## Quality Check (Internal)

Before outputting, ensure:

- [ ] Type is strictly one of the allowed types.
- [ ] Subject line is under 72 characters and uses imperative mood.
- [ ] Scope is specific, lowercase, and concise.
- [ ] The final output is exclusively a git commit command block for the user to run.
